## Recipe Professor Chaos 

#### Base Body Figure: The Sub-Mariner from Marvel Legends

Only work needed was grinding out slots for 1x2mm magnets. They are secured with Milliput.

#### Base Head: Marvels Electro, Spider-Man 2 Wave.   
   This needed more work than I signed up for, but worked out alright.
   
#### Mohawk: Garden wire covered with Greenstuff. 
This allows some posability. Not much at all but some to add character. 
   
#### Helmet: Transparent desk mat.
Cut to oversized, wrap around the head. Mark the visor. Fold in half and flatten, cut out visor. 

Prime, paint. Glue in place with hot glue.

### Hands: Greenstuff

The rectangles on back of the hands are made with greenstuff. Gauntlet things are already on Sub-mariner hands.

#### Leg wraps: Teflon tape

Holds in place without glue. Amazing.

#### Cape: Cotton, garden wire, magnets (!)
Old cotton t-shirt, about 180 grammature. 

Garden wire for bendy part.

Secured down with 1x10mm magnets.

Chain - some random bracelet got sacrificed.

#### Tunic: 80 Den Polyester

If none at hand, get old pantyhose. Seems creepy, but If it works, it ain't stupid.

#### Tunic Silver Lining: Tin foil, heatset fabric glue

Cut strips of tinfoil, cover with fabric glue. Wrap around edges of fabric,
